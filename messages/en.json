		"label": "FAQ",
		"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
		"items": {
			"faq-1": {
				"question": "What technologies do you specialize in?",
				"answer": "I specialize in React, Next.js (App Router), TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. I also work with state management (Zustand, Redux), testing (Jest, React Testing Library), and modern build/CI workflows. I prefer a component-driven architecture with strong typing and automated tests."
			},
			"faq-2": {
				"question": "Do you build accessible interfaces?",
				"answer": "Yes. Accessibility (WCAG) is part of my standard delivery: semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA where appropriate, and automated/auditory checks during CI. I include accessibility testing in acceptance criteria."
			},
			"faq-3": {
				"question": "Can you work with existing design systems or component libraries?",
				"answer": "Absolutely. I integrate with existing design systems and can either adapt components to match the system or create a scalable component library (tokens, stories, docs) when one is missing."
			},
			"faq-4": {
				"question": "What is your development workflow?",
				"answer": "I follow feature-branch Git workflow, small PRs with descriptive commits, peer reviews, automated tests, and CI that runs linting, type checks and tests. Releases are automated via CI/CD with versioned deployments and changelogs when needed."
			},
			"faq-5": {
				"question": "Do you write tests? What kind?",
				"answer": "Yes. I write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library, and add end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress for critical flows. Tests are part of the definition of done."
			},
			"faq-6": {
				"question": "How do you approach performance optimization?",
				"answer": "I optimize performance via code-splitting, lazy-loading, image optimization, caching headers, and careful bundle analysis. I also measure using Lighthouse and real-user metrics when available."
			},
			"faq-7": {
				"question": "Do you handle SEO and metadata for projects?",
				"answer": "Yes. For public-facing sites I implement semantic markup, structured data (JSON-LD), proper meta tags and server-side rendering or static rendering strategies for crawlability."
			},
			"faq-8": {
				"question": "Are you available for remote work and collaboration?",
				"answer": "Yes, I collaborate remotely using asynchronous tools (Slack, Notion, Figma, GitHub). I align work with your timezone and team rituals and use frequent check-ins for alignment."
			},
			"faq-9": {
				"question": "What is your typical delivery timeline for a medium-sized feature?",
				"answer": "A medium feature (component + integration + tests + docs) typically takes 2–5 working days, depending on complexity and review cycles. I prioritize incremental delivery so you get working value early."
			},
			"faq-10": {
				"question": "How do you handle design handoffs and collaboration with designers?",
				"answer": "I collaborate closely with designers using Figma: tokens extraction, responsive specs, and component parity. I provide prototypes and work with designers to keep components consistent and maintainable."
			},
			"faq-11": {
				"question": "Will I own the code and intellectual property?",
				"answer": "Yes. Unless otherwise agreed in a contract, delivered code and assets are transferred to the client with clear licensing and repository access. I can sign any standard IP assignment if required."
			},
			"faq-12": {
				"question": "Do you provide post-launch support and maintenance?",
				"answer": "Yes. I offer post-launch support packages for bug fixes, performance monitoring, and small improvements. I also recommend maintenance plans for dependency updates and security patches."
			},
			"faq-13": {
				"question": "How do you price projects or features?",
				"answer": "Pricing can be hourly or fixed depending on scope. I prefer fixed-price for well-defined scopes and hourly for exploratory work. I always provide a clear proposal breaking down deliverables, milestones and payment terms."
			},
			"faq-14": {
				"question": "Can you help with architecture decisions for larger apps?",
				"answer": "Yes. I provide architecture guidance including modularization, boundaries between frontend and backend, state management strategy, performance budgets, and CI/CD recommendations to scale the team and codebase."
			},
			"faq-15": {
				"question": "Do you contribute to open-source or provide references?",
				"answer": "I contribute to and maintain open-source projects and can share references or case studies on request. Open-source work demonstrates my coding standards and collaboration style."
			},
			"faq-16": {
				"question": "How should I get in touch to discuss a project?",
				"answer": "The best way is via the contact form below or a direct email. Provide a short brief, your goals, timeline, and any relevant links and I will respond with next steps and availability."
